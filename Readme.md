HACKER RANK DIY

Just a fun project trying to replicate the working of a code editor on
competitive programming sites ,

Working :

Two python files are used

-   Main.py which contains all the necessary print functions and write
    functions which updates the second file submission.py.

-   Line by line input is taken using while loop.

-   Subprocess library is used to execute submission.py right after
    giving input.

-   Print output is redirected to variable named output to compare it
    with correct answer using io library .
