HACKER RANK DIY

Just a fun project trying to replicate the working of a code editor on
competitive programming sites ,

Aim was to create a python script that prints out a programming question and takes python code as input and verifies if the answer is correct or not .



Working :

Two python files are used

-   Main.py which contains all the necessary print functions and write
    functions which updates the second file submission.py.

-   Line by line input is taken using while loop.

-   Subprocess library is used to execute submission.py right after
    giving input.

-   Print output is redirected to variable named output to compare it
    with correct answer using io library .
    
Outcome :
Understanding how we can take "input of code" in python script and run them simultaneously.

Features you can add :

- Time complexity checking
- Multiple test cases 
- GUI 
etc.
